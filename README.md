## Artefact Design and Development Process

This section explains the step-by-step process of designing and building the Agile workflows within Asana and Jira. Each artefact is developed with attention to standard Agile principles, ensuring it represents authentic Agile practices. Asana and Jira were chosen for their popularity and specific design to support Agile project management, particularly within the IT industry. Both tools offer extensive features for managing tasks, planning sprints, and fostering team collaboration, making them ideal for this study. The Initial Setup involves creating two project environments (one in Asana and one in Jira) with similar objectives, allowing for a fair comparison. Each tool’s environment will be configured to reflect Agile roles (e.g., product owner, Scrum master, team members) and project stages (backlog, sprint planning, etc.).

Task Management Design
Objective: To demonstrate how Asana and Jira enable efficient task management, from backlog creation to task assignment and tracking.
Artifact Design Steps:
Task Backlog Creation: Both tools are populated with a project backlog, listing tasks with detailed descriptions, priority levels, and dependencies.
Task Assignment and Scheduling: Tasks are assigned to specific team members, completion times are estimated, and deadlines are set.
Tracking and Progress Visualization: Each tool’s visual aids (e.g., Kanban boards in Jira, and task lists in Asana) are used to monitor task progression.

Sprint Planning and Execution
Objective: To assess each tool’s capacity to support sprint planning and track sprint progress, demonstrating how these functionalities align with Agile principles.
Artifact Design Steps:
Sprint Setup: Configure sprint cycles (e.g., two-week sprints) in both tools, including a sprint backlog and goals.
Sprint Planning Meeting Simulation: Outline a mock sprint planning session where tasks are moved from the backlog into the sprint cycle.
Execution and Daily Stand-Ups: Demonstrate how both tools allow tracking of daily progress and updating task status. This includes setting up “stand-up” features (e.g., comments, and status updates) to simulate daily team check-ins.

Collaboration and Communication Setup
Objective: To evaluate how each tool fosters collaboration, focusing on features like comments, @mentions, file sharing, and notifications.
Artifact Design Steps:
Collaborative Task Updates: Demonstrate how team members can update task status, add comments, and communicate directly within each tool.
Real-Time Notifications: Enable and document notification settings that alert team members of updates or changes in task status.
File Sharing and Documentation: Illustrate how files are uploaded and shared in both tools to support collaborative work.
